To run the example, follow these steps:

1) Make sure you have installed SimGrid (3.6.2 recommended).
   (http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/)

2) Inside MRA's root and examples directories, edit the Makefiles and change
   the INSTALL_PATH variable to match your SimGrid installation path
   (e.g. /usr).

3) Compile MRA++ with 'make' in the command line, and then do the same for the
   example.

4) Execute

./run.sh examples/plat32-10M.xml examples/d-plat32.xml examples/mrsg32.conf 


5) To create your platform_file use:

create-plat.py
create-deploy.py

It is necessary python installed in your system.
